                  operational and technical issues, route and flight
                  cancellations, and other similar factors. In such situations
                  where the company is informed in advance about the possibility
                  of booking dishonour, it will make its best efforts to provide
                  a suitable alternative or refund the booking amount after

                  refunded by the respective service operators. The user agrees
                  that the company, acting as an agent for booking services,
                  shall not be held responsible for any such circumstances, and
                  customers are required to directly contact the respective
                  service provider for further resolutions and refunds. The user
                  agrees that in cases of technical or other failures within the
                  company, there may be instances where previously committed
                  services cannot be provided or may require significant
                  modifications. In such cases, the company will refund the
                  entire amount received from the customer for availing those
                  services, minus applicable cancellation, refund, or other
                  charges, thereby discharging all liabilities of the company
                  related to the non-provision of services or deficiencies. Any
                  additional liabilities, if applicable, shall be borne by the
                  user. The company shall not be liable for delays or inability
                  to perform, in whole or in part, its obligations due to causes
                  beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to
                  acts of God, fire, strikes, embargoes, government actions,
                  acts of terrorism, or similar causes, as well as issues
                  arising at the end of airlines, railways, buses, hotels, or
                  other transport providers. In such events, affected users will
                  be promptly notified to the extent possible. Notwithstanding
                  anything stated above, the maximum liability of the company
                  under any circumstances, in relation to any services offered
                  on the site, shall be limited to the refund of the total
                  amount received from the customer for availing the services,
                  after deducting any applicable cancellation, refund, or other
                  charges. Under no circumstances shall the liability include
                  any loss, damage, or additional expenses beyond the amount
                  charged by the company for its services. In no event shall the
                  company and/or its suppliers be liable for any direct,
                  indirect, punitive, incidental, special, or consequential

                  charges for the services are clearly communicated to the
                  Customer before the services are rendered. Transparent

                  merchant and the Customer. The merchant is prohibited from

                  merchant must need to ensure that every transaction, whether
                  it involves bookings or cancellations, is carried out with the
                  full knowledge and consent of the customer. <br /> To ensure
                  compliance, merchants must retain customer requests and ID
                  proofs for ticket booking and cancellation at their outlets
                  for six months. These records should be made available to the
                  company or IRCTC upon request.
                  <br /> Failure to provide written requests and ID proofs may
                  result in a penalty of Rs. 5,000/- + Taxes per case.
                  Safeguarding these records is essential, and their
                  preservation is mandatory for the specified period. To ensure
                  a smooth communication and ticketing process, it is mandatory
                  to take the customer's or one of the passenger's mobile number
                  while booking a ticket. Merchants also must ensure the
                  accurate entry of mobile numbers on the Electronic Reservation
                  Slip (ERS). Failure to comply with this requirement may result
                  in a penalty of Rs. 5,000/- + Taxes per case. It is important
                  to double-check and accurately record the mobile numbers to
                  avoid any inconvenience or penalties. The Invoice should
                  include essential details such as the Railway Fare, IRCTC's
                  service charges, agent's service charges, and payment gateway
                  charges. It is important to provide a transparent breakdown of
                  these components to ensure clarity and accountability in the
                  billing process. By including these details in the Invoice,
                  customers can have a comprehensive understanding of the
                  charges associated with their transaction. It is mandatory for
                  the merchant to obtain a written request from the customers
                  before TDR cases are filed with the Railways. <br /> In the
                  absence of written request/soft copy of the customer for
                  filing TDR Claim, a penalty of Rs. 5000/- + Taxes per case
                  will be imposed. If cash cards are used, it is advisable to
                  retain the exhausted cards for refunds, if any. Merchant must
                  refund the money as per cancellation rules to the customer
                  immediately in all cases In case of refund of E-Tickets which
                  could not be cancelled on website and TDR has been filled, the
                  agent must inform the customer about the TDR refund process,
                  take contact details & remit the refund to the customer as and
                  when it is credited in the merchant/Agent ID. Merchants can
                  conveniently check the status of Ticket Deposit Receipt (TDR)
                  refunds through the <strong>Moneyoddr</strong>Portal. <br />{" "}
                  As per the policy, once the TDR claim amount is received by
                  the Agent/merchant from MoneyOddR, it should be refunded to
                  the customer within 5 working days. In the event that the TDR
                  claim amount is not refunded to the customer within the
                  specified time limit and is not returned to IRCTC, we take
                  this matter seriously. Non-refund of the TDR claim amount will
                  be considered a breach of policy, and appropriate penalties
